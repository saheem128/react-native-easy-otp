## Notes

The iOS input suggestion requires React Native 0.58+ and works for iOS 12 and above.

On Android, it will be auto filled when you press the copy code button in the notification bar. It will do so only if the code is sent after the view is loaded. So make sure you request the code **AFTER** this view is loaded.
